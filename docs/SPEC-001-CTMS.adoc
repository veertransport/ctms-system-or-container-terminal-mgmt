= SPEC-001: Container Terminal Management System (CTMS)
:sectnums:
:toc:


== Background

The company manages a container terminal where tracking container movements, managing yard inventory, and controlling gate operations are currently manual or handled using limited tools. This has led to operational inefficiencies, lack of real-time visibility, and limited accountability. A dedicated CTMS software is needed to digitize and streamline yard and gate operations, support role-based employee access, and ensure better data visibility and traceability.

== Requirements

*Must Have*
- Employee login system with role-based access (e.g., yard worker, gate operator, supervisor)
- Ability to add, update, and remove container records
- Manual tracking of container location in yard zones
- Gate IN/OUT logging with timestamps
- Container movement history (audit log)
- Mobile-friendly interface for use in the yard
- Basic reporting (inventory, daily movements)

*Should Have*
- Yard map interface (selectable zones)
- Notifications for idle or misplaced containers
- Dashboard for overview (in-yard, incoming, outgoing)

*Could Have*
- Integration with OneStop and other port/line systems
- Predictive analytics on container dwell time
- Crane/truck dispatch planning module

*Won’t Have (Yet)*
- GPS/sensor tracking
- Offline mode
- AI-based routing optimization
- Automated crane/drone control


== Method

=== Architecture Overview

The CTMS includes:

- **Web/Mobile Frontend** (React)
- **Backend REST API** (Python FastAPI or Node.js)
- **PostgreSQL Database** (AWS RDS)
- **Authentication** via AWS Cognito
- **Gate Operation Module**
- **Manual Yard Management**
- **Reporting & Audit Logs**

=== Database Schema

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Table | Description

| users
| Login credentials, roles (worker, gate_op, admin)

| containers
| Container ID, type, line, size, status (in-yard, out-gate)

| container_movements
| From/To yard zone logs, timestamped

| yard_zones
| Zone/slot metadata (zone_id, occupied)

| gates
| IN/OUT logs: container ID, vehicle info, timestamp, direction

| audits
| All user/system actions
|===

=== Functional Logic

- **Gate Operations**:
  - Log IN/OUT events
  - Create or update container record

- **Manual Yard Movement**:
  - Select new zone from available slots
  - Append entry to `container_movements`

- **Inventory Tracking**:
  - Fetch containers by zone, line, status

- **Reports**:
  - Daily summary of movements
  - Yard inventory
  - Historical movements

- **Roles**:
  - Yard Worker: Move containers, view yard
  - Gate Operator: Register IN/OUT entries
  - Admin: Manage users, audit logs, reports


== Implementation

=== Phase 1: System Setup

- AWS setup: RDS PostgreSQL, S3, ECS/Elastic Beanstalk, Cognito
- GitHub repo with `/frontend` and `/backend`

=== Phase 2: Backend

- User login & role validation
- Containers API (CRUD)
- Yard zones & movements API
- Gate operation endpoints
- Audit & reporting APIs

=== Phase 3: Frontend

- Login UI
- Dashboard (in-yard, outbound, idle)
- Yard map (dropdown/grid for zones)
- IN/OUT gate forms
- Container history & audit views

=== Phase 4: Reporting

- Inventory report
- Movement report (by container, date range)
- User action logs

=== Phase 5: Deployment

- Build React app → Deploy to S3 + CloudFront
- Backend containerized → Deploy to ECS or Beanstalk
- Set up domain with Route 53
- Enable HTTPS via AWS Certificate Manager

=== Phase 6: Testing & Launch

- Unit + integration testing
- UAT with yard & gate teams
- Final deploy + training


== Milestones

. Week 1: AWS infrastructure + repo setup
. Week 2-3: Backend core APIs and DB schema
. Week 4: Frontend login and container dashboard
. Week 5: Gate operation flow and yard movements
. Week 6: Reporting features
. Week 7: Final deployment and feedback round
. Week 8: Production launch


== Gathering Results

- **Usage Metrics**: Login activity, number of IN/OUT records per day
- **Operational Accuracy**: Reduction in misplaced/missing containers
- **User Feedback**: Yard and gate team input post-launch
- **System Logs**: Review audit logs and error reports
